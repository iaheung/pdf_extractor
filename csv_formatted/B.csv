BAME,"black, Asian and minority ethnic; spelled out in full at first mention, but where possible it is always preferable to be more specific and to avoid using BAME infurniture. Other alternatives are person/people of colour, or minority ethnic people. However, when using an alternative always check that it doesn’t change the accuracy of the story, eg the term minority ethnic in its broadest sense includes white people, such as Travellers and Gypsies, so if a story citing BAME research is actually only about people of colour, use of the term minority ethnic would be incorrect. Likewise, avoid using people of colour when the BAME research in question may include minority ethnic white people. (See also  black .)"

be-all and end-all,
bearing children,"Such phrases as “she bore him two sons” and “he had two children by” are outdated and sexist. We said of Wendi Deng that she “went on to bear [Rupert Murdoch] two children”. As a reader complained: “Surely an expression which implies that a woman has a child for a man has no place in the Guardian ... How about ‘they had two children’?”We also said that the late David Frost had “three sons by Carina Fitzalan-Howard” and referred to Mick Jagger’s “two sons by Jerry Hall”, as if the mothers were racehorses.

beef wellington,
"Beeton, Mrs","(Isabella Mary Beeton, 1836-65) author of The Book of Household Management"
begs the question,"This phrase is almost invariably misused: it means assuming a proposition that, in reality, involves the conclusion. An example would be to say that parallel lines will never meet, because they are parallel.The concept can be traced as far back as Aristotle, but HW Fowler, whose entry on begging the question is listed under the Latin  petitio principii  (assumption of the basis), defines it as “the fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself”, giving as an example “foxhunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun”.Now used widely to mean “raises the question”, its traditional sense is being lost, which seems a sad fate for a phrase that might be useful or even – in a logical or philosophical context – essential"

betting odds,"We frequently get this wrong. A brief explanation: long odds (eg 100-1 against, normally expressed as 100-1) mean something unlikely; shorter odds (eg 10-1) still mean it’s unlikely, but less unlikely; odds on (eg 2-1 on, sometimes expressed as 1-2) means it is likely, so if you were betting £2 you would win only £1 plus the stake.Take care using the phrase “odds on”: if Labour is quoted by bookmakers at 3-1 to win a byelection, and the odds are cut to 2-1, it is wrong to say “the odds on Labour to win were cut last night” – in fact, the odds against Labour to win have been cut (the shorter the price, the more likely something is expected to happen).It gets more complicated when something is genuinely odds-on, ie bookmakers quote a price of “2-1 on”: in this case, if the Labour candidate is quoted at 2-1 on and becomes an even hotter favourite, at 3-1 on, the odds have shortened; if Labour loses popularity, and 2-1 on becomes, say, 7-4 on or evens, the odds have lengthened"

beyond the pale,"not pail; this pale is derived from the Latin palus, a stake as used to support a fence (cf palisade); hence the figurative meaning of beyond the pale as being outside the boundary, unacceptable"
biannual or biennial?,"As no one can agree which of these means twice a year, and which means every two years, it’s best not to use them at all; “twice a year” or “every two years” are unambiguous.The same applies to bimonthly and biweekly: say “every fortnight”, “twice a month” or “every two months”, and so on. It’s remarkable that no one has sorted this problem out; nearly a century ago, HW Fowler was already calling it “a cause of endless confusion”"

Bible belt,
biblical quotations,"Use a modern translation, not the Authorised Version. From a reader: “Peradventure the editor hath no copy of Holy Writ in the office, save the King James Version only. Howbeit the great multitude of believers knoweth this translation not.

Wherefore let them be quoted in such manner that the people may understand”"

bitterest,"use of this word by the Guardian in 2006 provoked  a bitter controversy  among readers, many of whom (rightly) pointed out that there is nothing wrong with it"
black,"should be used only as an adjective when referring to race, ie not “blacks” but “black people” or whatever noun is appropriate. There is debate about the capitalisation of black, with some using it as a physical descriptor, others to describe a specific cultural group, therefore while generally lower case, if a subject, writer or editor of a story prefers to use Black then that choice should be respected.

blond,"is the adjective, male and female: John has blond hair, and Jane’s hair is also blond.As nouns, blond is male (John is a blond) and blonde is female (Jane is a blonde), but they sound old-fashioned and sexist nowadays (“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”) so it’s best to say simply that someone is blond"

Bloody Sunday,"Take care when writing about the death toll: 13 died in Derry on 30 January 1972, but a 14th victim died from a brain tumour several months later, so we should use a phrase such as “which led to 14 deaths”"

Bluffer’s Guide,"TM; beware of using phrases such as “a bluffer’s guide to crimewriting”, a headline that led to a legal complaint"
blunder,"one (of many) mentions of this word led to the following comment from a reader: “The term ‘blunder’ is used most frequently when referring to mistakes made in public services and this only serves to fuel the view commonly propagated by rightwing newspapers that the role of the public sector should be diminished and its functions handed over to private companies. I’m sure the Guardian does not endorse this view, but its use of language may imply that it does”"

Boris,"Some people (Arnie, Maggie, Iggy) have forenames that make them instantly recognisable, and Boris Johnson is one. This makes his name tempting for headlinewriters.

(A complete sentence that stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a stop.)“Square brackets,” the grammarian said, “are used in direct quotes when an interpolation [a note from the writer or editor, not uttered by the speaker] is added to provide essential information.”Use brackets sparingly, particularly square ones: it’s not necessary to add [David] in a football story when an interviewee refers to “Beckham”"
