names,"Prominent figures can just be named in stories, with their function at second mention: “Rishi Sunak said last night ...” (first mention); “the prime minister added ...” (subsequent mention).Where it is thought necessary to explain who someone is, write “Paul Heckingbottom, the Sheffield United manager, said …” or “the Sheffield United manager, Paul Heckingbottom, said”, etc.In such cases the commas around the name indicate there is only one person in the position, so write “the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said” (only one person in the job), but “the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock said” (there have been many).Do not leave out the definite article in such constructions as “style guru David Marsh said ...” It should be “The style guru David Marsh” (if there are other style gurus) or “David Marsh, the style guru, ...” (if you feel only one person merits such a description)"

national living wage,"is the official name, but it is informally and widely known as the minimum wage and it is fine to call it that in most cases. Bear in mind, however, that young people (those under 23 or under 21 from April 2024) can be paid less than this. From school leaving age they must receive what is officially known as the national minimum wage. Avoid calling the national living wage simply the living wage, as this causes confusion with the living wage advocated by the Living Wage Foundation, which is based on the cost of living and voluntarily paid by some employers.

net migration,"a term used by the UK’s Office for National Statistics and government to refer to the net number of people who have come to live in Britain from abroad. That means the number of people who have come, minus the number of people who have left the UK to move elsewhere.

Numbers from one to nine should also usually be written as figures when they come alongside a unit of measurement, for example 5 miles, 3kg, but use your discretion if a figure would look oddly precise, for example in a phrase such as: “He drank one pint and left.”"
numbskull,
numeracy,"Numbers have always contained power, and many a journalist will tremble at thevery sight of them. But most often the only maths we need to make sense of them is simple arithmetic. Far more important are our critical faculties, all too often switched off at the first sniff of a figure.It’s easy to be hoodwinked by big numbers in particular. But are they really so big? Compared with what? And what is being assumed? A government announcement of an extra £Xm a year will look far less impressive if divided by 60 million (the British population) and/or 52 (weeks in the year). That’s quite apart from the fact that it was probably trumpeted last week already, as part of another, bigger number.Never invent a big figure when a small one will do. Totting jail sentences together (“the six men were jailed for a total of 87 years”) is meaningless as well as irritating. Similarly, saying that something has an area the size of 150 football pitches, or is “eight times the size of Wales”, is cliched and may not be helpful.Be wary of using different ways of reporting comparable figures within a story. It is easier for readers to compare 6% and 10% than to compare 6% and one in 10.Similarly, writing: “The proportion of X who did Y has fallen from 8.64% to 6.3%” is bad form; the respective figures should be 8.6% and 6.3%.Avoid meaningless or false precision when reporting statistics. Think about whether it is useful to report a percentage of 57.743% or whether you should round it to 57.7% or even 58%. Particularly as many published statistics are estimates with a margin of error.If you decide to round up or round down, remember: anything halfway or over is rounded up, so 6.5%, for example, would become 7%, while 6.4% would become 6%.Here is an easy three-point guide to sidestepping common “mythematics” traps:"
"1  Be careful in conversions, don’t muddle metric and imperial, or linear, square and","cubic measures. Square miles and miles square are constantly confused: an area 10 miles square is 10 miles by 10 miles, which equals 100 square miles."
2  Be extremely wary of (or don’t bother) converting changes in temperature; you run,"the risk of confusing absolute and relative temperatures, eg while a temperature of 2C is about the same as 36F, a temperature change of 2C corresponds to a change of about 4F."
"3  When calculating percentages, beware the “rose by/fell by X%” construction: an","increase from 3% to 5% is a 2 percentage point increase or a 2-point increase, not a 2% increasethe  Nupes An alliance of leftwing political parties in France. For its full name use the translation New Popular Ecological and Social Union"
Nuremberg,
N-word,"to be spelt out only if essential to a story (for example, when quoting someone accused of using it) and only after discussion with senior editorial staff"
