Latin,"“Away with him! Away with him! He speaks Latin” (Shakespeare, Henry VI Part 2)Some people object to, say, the use of “decimate” to mean destroy on the grounds that in ancient Rome it meant to kill every 10th man; some of them are also likely to complain about so-called split infinitives, a prejudice that goes back to 19th-century Latin teachers who argued that as you can’t split infinitives in Latin (they are one word) you shouldn’t separate “to” from the verb in English. Others might even get upset about our alleged misuse of grammatical “case” (including cases such as dative and genitive that no longer exist in English).As our publications are written in English, rather than Latin, do not worry about any of this even slightly"

like or as if?,"Using like as a preposition (“ride like the wind”) is uncontroversial. Using it as a conjunction, introducing a clause that contains a verb (“ride like you’re riding a motorbike”, “he behaved like he was drunk”) will annoy many readers.The simple way to keep everyone happy is to use like when the verb is followed by a noun (“he ran like a gazelle”) and as if when the verb is followed by a clause (“he ran as if he had seen a ghost”).Ogden Nash pointed out that it’s As You Like It, not Like You Like It, although Shakespeare in fact did use like as a conjunction"
like or such as?,"“Cities like Manchester are wonderful” suggests the writer has in mind, say, Sheffield or Birmingham; it’s clearer to say “cities such as Manchester” if that is what she means.Do not, however, automatically change “like” to “such as” - the following appeared in the paper: “He is not a celebrity, such as Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler ... “"

This leads to inconsistencies, as when we refer to “Chingford, Essex” in one story and “Chingford, east London” in another.It is hard to be totally consistent - the preferences even of people who live in such places may vary (according to how long they have lived there, for example).In general, use London rather than the traditional counties - Ilford, east London; Bexley, south-east London, etc - unless a group or organisation specifically includes a county designation in its title"
