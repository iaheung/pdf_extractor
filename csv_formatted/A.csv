abbreviations and acronyms,"Do not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.If an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. Remember that our international online readership will not necessarily be aware of even well-known UK abbreviations. If an organisation is mentioned only once, it is not necessary to give its abbreviation or acronym.Cap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, “the word assassin contains four Ss”, etc"

Aboriginal Australians,"should be identified by their country or language groups at first mention if known, eg a Wiradjuri-Yorta Yorta man, a Noongar-Badimaya woman – or take your cue from how they identify themselves. The term “Aborigine” is outdated and offensive; Aboriginal should only be used as an adjective. Indigenous Australians is an umbrella term that covers both Aboriginal people from the Australian mainland and Torres Strait Islanders"
abortion,"Use  pro-choice ,   not pro-abortion; and use  anti-abortion , not pro-life.  Anti-choice can be used when talking about opposition to all reproductive rights, including abortion, birth control, family planning etc.In reference to US legislation,  six-week abortion ban  is preferable to foetal heartbeat bill, unless quoting someone talking about the “heartbeat bill”"

actor,"Use for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in the name of an award, eg Oscar for best actress. The Guardian’s view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, “lady doctor”, “male nurse” and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: “An actress can only play a woman. I’m an actor – I can play anything.”There is normally no need to differentiate between the sexes – and if there is, the words male and female are perfectly adequate: Lady Gaga won a Brit in 2010 for best international female artist, not artiste, chanteuse, or songstress.As always, use common sense: a piece about the late film director Carlo Ponti was edited to say that in his early career he was “already a man with a good eye for pretty actors ...” As the readers’ editor pointed out in the subsequent clarification: “This was one of those occasions when the word ‘actresses’ might have been used”"

Adidas,"initial cap, although adidas is lc in the company logo"
administration,"the Obama administration, etc"
"admissible, inadmissible",not -able
admit,Take care – as a reader put it when we referred to Tory MPs who “admitted” being gay: “Admit in modern English is almost exclusively used when conceding or confessing something negative and/or of which one is or should be ashamed. Please be more careful. Language can offend.” Quite.The former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee urged reporters not to “hide their biases and emotions behind subtly pejorative words” such as admit
ad nauseam,not ad nauseum
adoption,"Mention that children are adopted only when relevant to the story: a reader points out that “explicitly calling attention to adoptions in this way suggests that adoptionis not as good, and not as real a relationship, as having a child normally”.

Afrobeat or Afrobeats?,"These are distinct music genres which often get mixed up. The first was pioneered by Fela Kuti in the 1960s and is a mix of west African musical styles, such as fuji music and highlife, with American funk and jazz; the second is a style of danceable 21st-century west African pop. The term “Afrobeats” has come to be used too widely and reductively in the media and it is preferable to refer to contemporary African artists’ particular genre (pop, dance music, etc)"

Age UK,charity formed by the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged in 2009

Aids,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but normally no need to spell out.Do not use such terms as “Aids victims” or someone “suffering from Aids”, language that in the words of one reader is “crass, inaccurate and reinforces stigma”, implying helplessness and inviting pity; “people with Aids” or “living with Aids” are preferable.Do not use the term “full-blown Aids”.

Note that they are not called “Alice in Wonderland” and “Alice Through the Looking- Glass”"
A-list,"etc, but to refer to “C-list celebrities” and its variations has become tedious. An edition of G2 referred to “D-list celebrities” and, less than hilariously, in a separate piece about the same reality TV show, “Z-list celebrities”"
Al Jazeera,
alkyl nitrite,not nitrate; commonly known as poppers
Allah,Arabic for “the God”. Both words refer to the same concept: there is no major difference between God in the Old Testament and Allah in Islam. Therefore it makes sense to talk about “God” in an Islamic context and to use “Allah” in quotations or for literary effect

A simple “were” before “asked” would have fixed this.   Similarly:Labour warned of financial crash (did someone warn Labour of an impending crash, or did Labour warn someone else?)Tories paid millions to avoid tax Here not only does the reader have to ask whether the Tories paid millions or were paid millions, but also whether they paid millions of pounds or millions of people, and whether the Tories’ aim was to avoid tax or to enable the millions to avoid tax.

apostrofly,"“an insect that lands at random on the printed page, depositing an apostrophe wherever it lands” according to the Guardian’s former readers’ editor"
apostrophes,"used to indicate a missing letter or letters (can’t, we’d) or a possessive (David’s book).Don’t let anyone tell you that apostrophes don’t matter and we would be better off without them. Consider these four phrases, each of which means something different: my sister’s friend’s books (refers to one sister and her friend). my sister’s friends’ books (one sister with lots of friends). my sisters’ friend’s books (more than one sister, and their friend). my sisters’ friends’ books (more than one sister, and their friends).The possessive in words and names ending in S normally takes an apostrophe followed by a second S (Jones’s, James’s), but be guided by pronunciation and use the plural apostrophe where it helps: Mephistopheles’, Waters’, Hedges’ rather than Mephistopheles’s, Waters’s, Hedges’s.Plural nouns that do not end in S take an apostrophe and S in the possessive: children’s games, old folk’s home, people’s republic, etc.Phrases such as butcher’s knife, collector’s item, cow’s milk, goat’s cheese, pig’s blood, hangman’s noose, writer’s cramp, etc are treated as singular.Use apostrophes in phrases such as two days’ time, 12 years’ imprisonment and six weeks’ holiday, where the time period (two days) modifies a noun (time), but not in nine months pregnant or three weeks old, where the time period is adverbial (modifying an adjective such as pregnant or old) – if in doubt, test with a singular such as one day’s time, one month pregnant.Proper names that contain an apostrophe stay the same in the possessive: McDonald’s burgers may be delicious but Sainsbury’s are just as good.Some shops use an apostrophe, wrongly, to indicate a plural (“pea’s”), but will generally omit the apostrophe when one is actually required (“new seasons asparagus”), a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the greengrocer’s (or grocer’s) apostrophe. Try to avoid this"
app,"an application for, typically, a mobile phone"
appal,"but as the former Prince of Wales might have said, it really is appalling"
apparatchik,
appeal,"In British English you appeal against a decision, verdict, etc, you do not “appeal the verdict”.

Do Guardian journalists not read the style guide?” Not all of them, evidently"

appraise,to evaluate
apprise,to inform
April Fools’ Day,"also known, less commonly nowadays, as All Fools’ Day; an individual prank, or the victim of one, is an April fool, so you might say “one of the greatest April fools was the Guardian’s  San Serriffe issue of 1977  – it made April fools of all who were taken in”"
apropos,"Used most commonly to mean “with regard to”, it does not need a preposition, so “apropos your question ... “ But note the idiomatic “apropos of nothing ...” which means something like “changing the subject” or “incidentally”.Used to mean “pertinent” or “relevant to”, now rather rare, you might say “the thought was apropos to this” or, even more quaintly, “the point was apropos”.The French idiom “à propos de bottes” (“with regard to boots”), meaning without rhyme or reason, was used by, among others, George Orwell"
aquarium,plural aquariums
Arab,"Both a noun and an adjective, and the preferred adjective when referring to Arab things in general, eg Arab history, Arab traditions. Arabic usually refers to the language and literature: “the Arabic press” means newspapers written in Arabic, while “the Arab press” would include newspapers produced by Arabs in other languages.There is no simple definition of an Arab. At an international level, the 22 members of the Arab League can safely be described as Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. At a human level, there are substantial groups within those countries – the Berbers of north Africa and the Kurds, for example – who do not regard themselves as Arabs."
Arabic names,"Though Arabic has only three vowels – a, i and u – it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity – which often puts a strain on all three.Typically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as “Mr John” or “Dr David”). Often Arabs also havefamiliar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as “Abu Ahmad”, and a woman as “Umm Ahmad”, the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).Where a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.Note also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen.Some guidelines (for use particularly where there is no established transliteration)"
al-,"Means “the”. In names it is not capitalised, eg Ahmad al-Saqqaf, and can be dropped after the first mention (Mr Saqqaf). For placenames we drop it altogether. Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally “the God”) is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, “al” is actually “aal” and does not mean “the”)."
"abdul, abu and bin","These are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: abdul means “slave of … “ and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, “slave of the merciful one”, “slave of the generous one”, etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, “abd” (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name; abu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf. Despite the above, some people are actually known as “Abdul”. This is more common among non-Arab Muslims. And some Arabs run “abd” or “abu” into the following word, eg the writer Abdelrahman Munif."
Muhammad,"Our style for the prophet’s name and for most Muhammads living in Arab countries, though where someone’s preferred spelling is known we respect it, eg Mohamed Al Fayed, Mohamed ElBaradei"
"Muhandis/Mohandes, Qadi","Be wary of names where the first word is Muhandis or Qadi: these are honorary titles, meaning engineer and judge respectively"
European surnames of Arabic origin,"The guidelines above do not apply in examples such as the French labour minister, Myriam El Khomri. She is French born and only has one surname, which appears on her birth certificate and passport, written in the Latin alphabet; there is no other spelling. So she should be referred to as Myriam El Khomri at first mention and El Khomri thereafter.Similarly, the two 2016 Brussels airport suicide bombers, Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, were Belgian born. The Belgian legal system and prosecutors refer to them by the surname El Bakraoui, and we should too"

The median is described as “the value below which 50% of employees fall”, ie it is the wage earned by the middle person when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest to largest. (For even numbers there are two middle people, but you calculate the mean average of their two wages.)The median is often a more useful guide than the mean, which can be distorted by figures at one extreme or the other"
