each other or one another?,Some traditionalists say the former should apply only to two people (“Iniesta and Xavi hugged each other”) and the latter to more than two (“all 11 Spanish players hugged one another”).

Elephant and Castle,area;  Elephant & Castle  station
elephant in the room,"Like governments and reality TV series, metaphors that we once welcomed into our lives as refreshing can become all too familiar, to the point of tedium – and this cliche is a fine example.At its height, elephants were not only in the room, but had taken over the whole house: “elephants in the room” included trade figures, policy, lack of policy, climate change, Iraq, the US, Europe, anti-Americanism, men, women, single women, a new French football league, race, religion, Islam, Catholicism, Tessa Jowell, Andrew Neil, Jimmy Greaves, fatness, thinness, Stalinism, Hitler and Tony Blair’s departure from office.The phrase seemed destined for the elephants’ graveyard but there is evidence that, used imaginatively, it may still be effective: “There’s only so long they can ignore this elephant in the room [the Iraq war] before it takes a dump on the carpet” (Gary Younge, 5 July 2010); and, from the same writer: “Money in American politics was already an elephant in the room.

As such, the second name does not function in the same way as a western surname and people should be referred to by their first name on second mention, eg the athlete Kenenisa Bekele becomes Kenenisa thereafter. There can be exceptions to this – a person may always be referred to by their first and second names together – so it is worth checking. Also, people are sometimes given their grandfather’s first name as a third name, but this tends to function in a similar way to a western middle name and is not included in everyday usage"

eyewitness,"The pace at which a fresh metaphor becomes a tired cliche seems to have increased in recent years; this one saw a huge increase in 2009 – although curiously, while “eye-watering” is only ever applied to money (“eye-watering sums”), its adverbial near relative is more versatile (“an eye-wateringly beautiful woman”, “an eye- wateringly sharp sauvignon” and so on). The danger, as ever, is that the expression loses its force from overuse"
Eyjafjallajökull,"one word, but witness is preferable, except in the Guardian’s Eyewitness picture spread"
