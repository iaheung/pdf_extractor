CAP,common agricultural policy
capitals,"“I am a poet: I distrust anything that starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop” (Antjie Krog)Times have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate hand- illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).A look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.Our style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is impossible to be wholly consistent – there are almost always exceptions, so if you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the main principles:"
jobs,Guardian.
titles,"president, Barack Obama, and Obama on subsequent mention); the Duke of Westminster (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis but the pope."
government departments in English-speaking countries,"Initial capitals when full name is used, eg Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Justice (UK), Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security (US), Department of Immigration and Border Protection (Australia), Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Irish Republic), Ministry of Railways (India). Lowercase when abbreviated or paraphrased, eg justice ministry, defense department, Australia’s immigration department, Canadian fisheries ministry, Indian railway ministry, etc. Lowercase for translations of government departments in non-English-speaking countries, eg French foreign ministry, Russian ministry of emergency situations, etc."

captions,
"car bomb, car park","Captions are an opportunity to give readers further information, rather than insulting their intelligence by stating the obvious.A photograph illustrating an election in Croatia, say, may show a woman pushing a pram past a hoarding covered with candidates’ posters. The caption tells us: ‘A woman pushes a pram past a hoarding covered with election posters in Zagreb,’ whereas it might say: ‘Polls indicate that women’s votes will be a deciding factor in the Croatian election.’Please avoid cliches such as ‘sharing a joke’ and ‘in happier times’.There is no need to put (left) after one of the names in a caption showing, say, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa or William Hague and Angelina Jolie.(Alt text, in contrast to a caption, should be a simple written description of what can be seen in a photo, illustration or graphic, so it can be read by screen readers.)"

child sexual abuse,
chilli,"rather than “child sex”; so for example we would refer to a “child sexual abuse ring” rather than a “child sex ring”, but say “child sex offender” rather than “child sexual offender”.Say  child sexual abuse images  or  child abuse images  rather than “child pornography”, “child porn” and especially the tabloid “kiddy porn”. The NSPCC says that such terms give “a misleading and potentially trivialising impression of what is a very serious crime”, and favours the term “child abuse images”.Avoid using the term “historical” to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes. Try to date the crimes (year, decade etc) instead, or say they happened in the past eg “Detectives are investigating allegations of child sexual abuse from more than 30 years ago.” Exceptions may be necessary in court cases where specific wording is required. (See also  abuse. )A footnote with details about support services should be added to stories about child sexual abuse from a relevant selection of the following: The  NSPCC  offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood ( Napac ) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331."

colleges,
Colombia,"take initial caps, eg West Kent College; but not when college forms part of the name of a school, eg Bash Street sixth-form college, Eton college"
colon,South American country that we frequently misspell as “Columbia”
colonel,"Use between two sentences, or parts of sentences, where the first introduces a proposition that is resolved by the second, eg Fowler put it like this: to deliver the goods invoiced in the preceding words.A colon, rather than a comma, should be used to introduce a quotation: “He was an expert on punctuation,” or to precede a list – “He was an expert on the following: the colon, the comma and the full stop.”Use before quotes when the quote could stand on its own as a sentence. He said: “You’ll never take me alive.”When a colon is used in a headline, the next word is usually lowercase, eg Osborne: there is no plan B. One exception to this rule is in web furniture where the colon comes after the title of a series, for example as in the headline “Digested week: Words mattered to Stephen Sondheim”. Similarly, in a standfirst after a descriptive tag such as “Exclusive” or “Analysis” the next word should take an initial cap. Another exception on the web is when the colon introduces a complete sentence in quotation marks, such as Maro Itoje: ‘Whenever England take the field we should win’This 2010 example from the Guardian is an awful (but by no means isolated) example of the tendency to use a semicolon where only a colon will do (all the more unfortunate for distracting the reader from a funny sentence): “Here’s a task for the new coalition government; set up a Drumming Taskforce today, and appoint a Snare Tsar.”We are in danger of losing the distinction between colon and semicolon; many writers seem to think they are interchangeable but to make it clear: they are not."
Columbia,

commented,plural commandos
commingle,"Use a comma to help the reader by inserting breathing space into a sentence: “When the Dutch reflect on their performance in the World Cup final, they will not find it hard to see why their aggressive tactics lost them many friends in 2010.”“The editor, Katharine Viner, is a woman of great vision” – commas if there is only one editor.“The subeditor Amelia Hodsdon is all style and no substance” – no commas if there is more than one subeditor.A misplaced comma can sabotage a sentence, as in this example from the paper: “Neocon economists often claim a large, black economy turbo-powers growth ...” (the writer was talking about a big black economy, not a big and black one, which is not the same at all).A comma is also crucial to avoid ambiguity in examples such as this: “Part of the report will heavily criticise a so-called power culture among the Dublin bishops who have been accused of not taking the allegations seriously.” We should have inserted a comma after “bishops” to make clear that all the Dublin bishops have been accused; as published, the sentence implies that only some of the bishops have."

Concord,"Tricky, but to get these right, just remember that comprise or consist of mean “made up of” while compose and constitute mean “make up”.So you might say a band comprises guitar, bass, drums and keyboards or that it consists of guitar, bass, drums and keyboards. You can also say the band is composed of those instruments. Alternatively, you could say guitar, bass, drums and keyboards compose or constitute the band.The one thing to avoid, unless you want people who care about such things to give you a look composed of, consisting of and comprising mingled pity and contempt, is “comprised of”"

consult,plural  consortiums  not consortia
consumer price index (Australia),lc as in the US constitution

conversion practices,"Do not overuse contractions such as aren’t, can’t, couldn’t, hasn’t, don’t, I’m, it’s, there’s and what’s (even the horrific “there’ve” has appeared); while they might make a piece more colloquial or easier to read, they can be an irritant and a distraction, and make a serious article sound frivolous.

convertible,not convenor

Co-operative Bank (,"We give metric measures and convert on first mention only to imperial in brackets (exceptions: miles and pints); if a rough figure is given in metric, do not convert it into an exact figure in imperial, and vice versa, eg if someone says the towns are about 50km apart, convert to 30 miles, not “31.07 miles”; the same goes for rough amounts of currencies, though don’t round up £3.6bn to £4bn"

credible,"drunk; hence  crapula , hangover"
credulous,"both are more objective than, and therefore usually preferable to, the term accident when describing traffic incidents.

As an example, a person can announce they wish to be cryogenically frozen, but their decision may restart the debate about the ethics of cryonics"
cucumiform,
cull,"boys (and now girls) aged from eight to 10, organised in packs but no longer known as “Wolf Cubs”; avoid dated “Dyb Dyb Dyb, Dob Dob Dob” jokes but if relevant, it is spelt thus (it stands for “do your best” and we will “do our best”), and not “Dib”"

currencies,"The plural is cupfuls, as with spoonfuls, but it’s three cups full, three spoons full"
currently,"Used nowadays to mean good in parts (“this was a curate’s egg of a match”), the expression originally, and more subtly, meant to deliberately gloss over the truth – the curate was trying to spare his bishop’s feelings, or perhaps his own embarrassment, when served a bad egg, by saying: “Oh no, My Lord, I assure you! Parts of it are excellent!” (cartoon in Punch, 9 November 1895)"
cusp,restrain;  kerb  pavement
custody,"for most currencies – for example yen, yuan, afghani – we spell out the full name rather than use a symbol or abbreviation, eg 100 yuan, 100,000 yen. Exceptions are the pound, the euro and dollars. For currencies we habitually refer to with their nationality, such as Swiss francs, you don’t need to keep repeating the nationality or, indeed, to state it at all if it is clear from the context whose currency you are referring to – just say 100 francs.Whenever the whole word for a currency is used it is lc: euro, pound, sterling, dong, etc. Abbreviate dollars like this: $50 (US dollars); A$50 (Australian dollars); HK$50 (Hong Kong dollars); C$50 (Canadian dollars). In stories where there may be confusion between US dollars and the local dollar, say US$ for clarity.Convert all foreign amounts to sterling (or the local dollar if you are working in the US or Australia) in brackets at first mention, but use common sense – there is no need to put £500,000 in brackets after the phrase “I feel like a million dollars.”You can add more than one currency conversion in brackets, where appropriate, for a global story with a wide online readership. For example: “Unilever is to cut 7,500 jobs globally and spin off its ice-cream division as part of an overhaul aimed at saving about €800m (£680m, $850m) over the next three years.” But please try to avoid making this conversion in the introduction or furniture.Take care when converting old money to new: some of our attempts have been meaningless, in that they have ignored the relative value of sums involved. We said in an obituary, for example, that Ronnie Barker was paid £1 9s (£1.45) a week for his first job in 1947 – a comparison of average earnings would convert that to around £113 today.Similarly, in converting the price of a “four shilling dish of rice and vegetables” in 1967 to 20p in today’s money we forgot to allow for its relative value; taking into account changes in the retail price index it would now be worth £2.23.There are some excellent websites to assist with such conversions"
"Customs, Revenue & Customs","“now” is usually preferable, if needed at all"
cutbacks,"a place where two points meet (eg “on the cusp of Manchester and Salford”, “on the cusp of Taurus and Gemini”), which may be extended metaphorically to a place or time where two things or groups of things come into contact, as in this elegant example from the Review: “It was a world caught on the cusp between postwar recession, stasis and a dying moral code, and the colour, mobility and licence of the 60s.”Writers who use cusp under the impression that it is a clever way to say on the brink of or about to (“on the cusp of adolescence”, “on the cusp of the final”, “tanker drivers are on the cusp of striking over a coming supermarket-led cut in their wages”, “the garlic was on the cusp of bursting into a constellation of white stars”) are, sadly, mistaken"
