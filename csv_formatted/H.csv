head-butt,
"headdress, headhunter, headroom",but  butt  should normally suffice
headed or heading?,but  head-on
headlines,The former is most commonly used as past tense (“we headed for the exit”) and the latter as present participle (“we are heading in the right direction”); try not to mix them up – “we are headed in the right direction” sounds inelegant at best
headquarters,"What makes a great, or at least memorable, headline? They can be historic (“Manwalks on Moon”), campaigning (“He lied and lied and lied”), classical (“Between Cilla and Charybdis”), subtle (“Flo quiets the Dons”), funny (“Super Caley go ballistic – Celtic are atrocious”), notorious (“Gotcha!”), scurrilous (“Zip me up before you go-go”), or downright absurd (“Freddie Starr ate my hamster”). There is no magic formula but here are a few guidelines.Use active verbs where possible, particularly in news headlines: “Editor updates style guidelines” is much better than “Style guidelines updated”.Avoid tabloid cliches such as bid, brand, dub and slam, and their broadsheet counterparts such as insist, signal and target. Imagining that you are describing an event, in words, to real people, is a good antidote to journalese: no one in a pub says “Did you see that Brown slammed Blair in a dramatic power bid?”Just as we would in copy, we need to take care with words such as debacle, farce and fiasco, especially when combined, which we contrived to do in the headline “Hips fiasco descends into farce”– the fact that “Hips farce descends into fiasco” would work just as well tells you something is probably wrong here.Strive to be fresh: tired plays on the phrase “Mind the gap”, heard only occasionally these days by passengers on the London underground, have become tedious, as well as either baffling or infuriating to readers who do not happen to live in the capital.Take care over ambiguity: “Landmine claims dog UK arms firm”, which appeared in the paper, contains so many successive nouns, some of which may or may not be verbs, that you have to read it several times to work out what it means.Exclamation marks – look, I’ve written something funny! – should never be used. Question marks are also to be avoided, as are quotation marks, unless essential to signify a quote or for legal reasons. And we should resist the temptation to save space by replacing “and” with a comma: “Blair and Brown agree euro deal” not “Blair, Brown agree euro deal”.Puns are fine – “Where there’s muck there’s bras”, about a farmer’s wife who started a lingerie business from a barn, was voted headline of the year by our staff – but do not overuse, or resort to tired puns such as “flushed with success” (this story has got a plumber in it). It is possible to try just a little too hard (“To baldly grow where no mane’s grown before”). In the 1970s and 80s the Guardian suffered from a reputation for excruciating puns; today, we want to be known for clever, original and witty headlines.Unexpected twists, or subtle plays on words and phrases, show the subeditor’s craft at its best: a power failure in a theatre became, in the Guardian, “Bad lights stop play”. A light touch can work beautifully: “Drop dead, gorgeous”, on a story about office jealousy, added one comma to a well-known film title to create the perfect headline. When Tate Modern exhibited a giant sun, to create its own indoor climate, the beautiful headline written by the Guardian’s Steve Chamberlain – “But is itweather?” (a rare example of a question mark being required) – deserved to be framed and exhibited in a gallery in its own right.Be careful when making references to popular culture: “Mrs Culpepper’s lonely hearts club banned” works, because most people are familiar with the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, but allusions to your favourite obscure prog-rock LP are likely to pass over most readers’ heads. Long after most people had forgotten the 1960s movie Charlie Bubbles, tabloid sports subeditors continued to mystify their readers by using the headline “Charlie bubbles” whenever anyone called Charlie scored a goal. “Book lack in Ongar”, about a shortage of resources in Essex libraries, remains one of the all-time great headlines, but it only works if you get the reference to John Osborne’s 1956 play Look Back in Anger (or at least it did until Oasis helpfully recorded a song called Don’t Look Back in Anger).It’s time for some formulaic headlines to be given a decent burial, or at least a long rest. “The kids are alright” (based on a song by the Who, and subsequently a film) crops up, with minor variations, on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in British newspapers: “The kids are alright online”, “The kids are all right (and left)”, “The kids are all right, left and centre”, and so on.Even more ubiquitous are “Size isn’t everything” and its close relative “Size doesn’t matter”, used to refer to a car (in two different newspapers), school uniforms, the actor Simon Callow’s height, a hotel in Turkey, new houses, national economies, motorbikes, a footballer, the gallery following a golf tournament, and – once – penis size.The ever-popular “Brighton rocks” and its variations are an allusion, still common, to the Graham Greene novel and subsequent film, both more than 50 years old. How many people still understand the reference? “So lucky, lucky, lucky”, a recent headline we used above a photograph of Kylie Minogue, quoted lyrics from a hit she had in nearly 20 years ago. How many of our readers would be aware of this? You have to use your judgment.If you are quoting, be sure to get it right. “Talkin’ about their generation”, from a classic 1960s song by the Who, fails as a headline because it literally lacks rhythm (it should be “Talkin’ ‘bout”). We claimed that Millwall fans sing “No one likes us and we don’t care”; they don’t sing that, and the mistake made it look as if we don’t care.As always, the most important thing is to think of the readers and remember that we are writing headlines for their benefit, not for our own amusement or to show how clever we are."

historic or historical?,Refers to someone from a country where the primary language is Spanish
Historic England,"A historic event is notable, a historical event simply something that happened in the past. So someone might be accused of historical crimes that happened years earlier.However, avoid using the term historical to describe sexual abuse crimes from the past. Survivors, particularly adults who were abused as children, feel the term undermines the long-lasting impact of the crimes. Try to date the crimes (year, decade etc) instead, or say they happened in the past eg “Detectives are investigating allegations of child sexual abuse from more than 30 years ago.” Exceptions may be necessary in court cases where specific wording is required.Note that it’s “a” not “an”, unless directly quoting: “an historic” is considered old- fashioned, and in modern English “a historic”, “a hotel” and so on sound more natural.

Why some people are upset by “hopefully we will win” and not “sadly we lost” is a mystery"
