"one in six, one in 10","Phrases of this sort should be treated as plural. There are good grammatical and logical reasons for this. Compare “more than one in six Japanese is 65 or older … “ with “more than one in six Japanese are 65 or older … “Grammatically, we are talking not about the noun “one” but the noun phrase “one in six”, signifying a group of people. Logically, the phrase represents a proportion – just like “17%” or “one-sixth”, both of which take plural verbs. “Two out of every seven” and “three out of 10” take plurals too, functioning identically.“One in six is … “ is also unnecessarily (and possibly misleadingly) specific, implying that of any six people from the group you take, exactly one will be as described. “One in six” means one-sixth on average over the whole group, and a plural verb better reflects this. We wouldn’t say “Only 1% of Republican voters is able to point to Iraq on a map” just because there’s a “one” in there"
