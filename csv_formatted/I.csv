Icelandic names,"Icelandic people are referred to by their first names on second mention eg the former prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, then Jóhanna thereafter. This is because last names are typically patronymic, indicating the person is the son or daughter of the father, and are not, like most western last names, an indication of family lineage eg Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir is Jóhanna, the daughter (dóttir) of Sigurðar Egill Ingimundarson. There are occasional exceptions to this so it is always worth checking."
iconic,"in danger of losing all meaning after an average three appearances a day in the Guardian and Observer, employed to describe anything vaguely memorable or well-known – from hairdressers, storm drains in Los Angeles and the Ferrero Rocher TV ads to Weetabix, the red kite and the cut above the eye David Beckham sustained after being hit by a flying boot kicked by Sir Alex Ferguson. Our advice, even if our own writers rarely follow it, is to show a little more thought, and restraint, in using this term"
