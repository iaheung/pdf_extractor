Bold Text,Description
dachshund,
Dad or dad?,"capital D if it’s just Dad, eg “I’ll have to ask Dad”; otherwise lowercase, eg “my dad was a dustman, what does your dad do?” etc"

"Dagalo, Mohamed Hamdan","Sudanese military leader, also known as Hemedti"

DaimlerChrysler,
Dakar,capital of Senegal;  Dhaka  capital of Bangladesh
dal,not dhal
Dalai Lama,no abbreviation: he is always the Dalai Lama
Dalek,"takes initial cap, whether used literally (as in referring to Doctor Who), or figuratively (as in describing, say, your boss)"
"Dalí, Salvador",(1904-89) Spanish surrealist
dancefloor,one word (thanks to Arctic Monkeys for this one)
dangling participles,"(also known as hanging participles)Avoid constructions such as “having died, they buried him”; the pitfalls are nicely highlighted in Mark Lawson’s novel Going Out Live, in which a TV critic writes: “Dreary, repetitive and well past the sell-by date, I switched off the new series of Fleming Faces.”Another example, from a leading article: “Due out in January as a white paper, Ms Kelly may be unable to overcome Mr Blair’s apparent determination to stick with A- levels.”And this particularly exotic dangling participle somehow found its way into the paper: “Though long-legged and possessing a lovely smile, gentleman journalists aren’t looking up her skirt and wouldn’t even if she weren’t gay”"
danish pastry,
Dar es Salaam,
dark ages,
darknet,
dashcam,
dashes,"A single dash can add a touch of drama – like this. But use sparingly.A pair of dashes are an alternative to commas or brackets for parenthesis when you want to draw the reader’s attention to something surprising or unusual. An example from the paper of how not to do it: “Many neighbours in the block – which sits close to the banks of the Thames – were visibly shaken.” The block’s innocuous location does not need underlining with dashes. Commas would suffice.Beware sentences – such as this one – that dash about all over the place – commas (or even, very occasionally, brackets) are often better; semicolons also have their uses.Dashes should be en dashes rather than em dashes or hyphens"
data,"takes a singular verb (like agenda), though strictly a plural; you come across datum, the singular of data, about as often as you hear about an agendum"
"datacentre, dataset",
dates,"Our style is: 21 July 2016 (day month year; no commas).21 July-6 August, 6-10 August, etc.In the 21st century but 21st-century boy; fourth century BC; AD2007, 2500BC, 10,000BC.Use figures for decades: the 1960s, the swinging 60s, etc.Should you have occasion to say 2016 out loud, for example in a podcast, pronounce it “twenty sixteen”, not “two thousand and sixteen”"
"daughter of, son of","Think twice before referring to people in these terms. Often only the person’s father is described and such descriptions can smack of snobbery as well as sexism.Simplistic labels may also be misleading: we published a clarification after calling Captain James Cook the son of a Scottish farm labourer. True enough, but Cook’s mother was a Yorkshire woman and he is a famous son of Yorkshire"
"Davison, Emily",suffragette who died four days after stepping in front of George V’s horse at the 1913 Derby

D-day,"6 June 1944, or used figuratively (“Monday is D-day for the Blades’ promotion hopes”)"
"Dbeibah,",prime minister of Libya’s Tripoli-based government
deaf ears,"Avoid or say “closed ears”; the phrase is not just a rather lazy cliche but offensive to many deaf people. For the same reason, do not use “dialogue of the deaf”: most deaf people are perfectly capable of conducting a dialogue using BSL and other sign languages. The term “deaf mute” is also outdated and offensive; “deaf”, where relevant, will suffice.Note that a hearing aid is not a “deaf aid” (although we contrived to use the phrase in a crossword in August 2012)"
deathbed,but  death row
debacle,"no accents; like farce and fiasco, to be used sparingly in news reporting"
debatable,
debate,"In British English, if you debate Boris Johnson he is the subject of the discussion; you would debate  with  Boris Johnson if he were your opponent"
"Deben, Lord","Deben at second mention. If you are referring to things he did in the years before his peerage, for example while environment secretary, it is helpful to also point out his name is John Gummer"
decades,"1950s, etc; use figures if you abbreviate: roaring 20s, swinging 60s, a woman in her 70s, the first reader’s email of the 00s (pronounced, unfortunately, “noughties”)"
deceptively,"ambiguous (in one survey, half the respondents thought “deceptively easy” meant easy, and half thought it meant hard), and therefore best avoided – advice unlikely to be heeded, sadly, by estate agents"
decimate,"nowadays used to mean destroy (yes, we know it originally meant to kill one in 10) See Latin"

deja vu,"defined as the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past (whether it has actually happened or not). So watching England underperforming and being knocked out of a major football tournament at an early stage, for example, might be said to induce a sense of deja vu"

delusion or illusion?,"“That the sun moves round the Earth was once a delusion, and is still an illusion” (Fowler)"
dementia,"not “senile dementia”.We should take care to refer to a person or people with dementia, or living with dementia, not as a “dementia sufferer” or “victims of dementia”.Dementia is an umbrella term that refers to various conditions. Some of the more common types of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia, and fronto-temporal dementia (eg Pick’s disease). Respect people’s choices about how they identify themselves, for example as someone with Alzheimer’s disease rather than dementia"
DeMille,(1881-1959) Hollywood producer and director; the B stood for Blount
"Democrat, Democratic","In American politics, Democrat is a noun, Democratic an adjective: Kamala Harris is a Democrat, and a member of the Democratic party.The distinction is important because the Republicans use “Democrat” as an adjective, eg “Democrat party”, in a pejorative way"
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"DRC on second mention; not to be confused with its smaller neighbour Congo- Brazzaville (which is also known as the Republic of the Congo); both countries border the Congo river.

"denazify, denazification",
"Dench, Dame Judi",not Judy
Deng Xiaoping,
denier,"one who denies, as in “Holocaust denier”; there is no such word as “denialist”.The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions”, which is highly flattering to “climate change sceptics” who are literally in denial about the overwhelming scientific evidence and deny that climate change is happening or is caused by human activity, so denier is the more accurate, and our preferred, term.denier is also a unit of weight for fibre, eg 10-denier tights"
"De Niro, Robert",
denouement,no accent
departments of state,"British government ministries (but not ministers) take initial caps, as follows:Cabinet Office (but the cabinet) Department for Business and Trade (DBT) Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Department for Education (DfE) Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) Department for International Development (DfID) – no longer exists after merging with the Foreign Office in 2020 Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) Department for Transport (DfT) Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, or Foreign Office (FCDO) Home Office Ministry of Defence (MoD) Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Ministry of Justice (MoJ) Northern Ireland Office Office of the Leader of the House of Commons Scotland Office, not Scottish Office Treasury Wales Office, not Welsh OfficeUse the abbreviations in brackets sparingly, especially the clumsy ones: business department, culture and sport department, and so on are fine, or just the department, the ministry, etc.Departments and ministries of other English-speaking countries also take an initial capital, eg US Department of State, Indian Ministry of Railways.Departments and ministries of non-English-speaking countries are lc, eg French ministry of the interior, Iraqi foreign ministry"

"DeVito, Danny",
devolution in the UK,"This has proved to be a hazardous area for headline writers, copy editors and writers. Remember that many of the decisions taken by the UK government apply only in England. This is particularly true in areas such as health and education. So please take great care before adding the words British or UK to headlines and copy and make sure that what is being reported applies to the whole of the UK and not just England.In terms of job titles, however, it is not strictly correct to refer to, for example, the health secretary in the UK government as the English health secretary. The most accurate formulation is to say they are the UK government health secretary. But also spell out, if it is relevant, where their responsibilities are confined to England. It is not incorrect to refer to the UK health secretary, but this can be misleading and should particularly be avoided if what is being discussed applies only to England. All this also applies to the UK government’s education secretary"
diabetes,"a lifelong condition that causes a person’s blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2, and it is important to distinguish between the two.Type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce any insulin, comprises about 10% of cases but is the most common type of childhood diabetes. Type 1 is an auto- immune disease, cause unknown (although genetics is believed to play a part). Weight is not a factorType 2 diabetes, where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin, comprises about 90% of adult cases. Obesity, lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet have contributed to an increase in the number of adults developing type 2 diabetes.Refer to “people with diabetes” rather than calling them diabetics"

If you can, clarify that for the reader, by saying, for example, the “left bank of the Dnipro, to the east”, but do check the location on a map as the orientation varies along the course of the river.

domestic abuse/family abuse (,"Both terms are acceptable, and a mention, where relevant, that a story involves domestic/family abuse is helpful for clarity. (It is also preferred by some advocacy groups.)
